# Enasis Network Ansible Provision Collection

> :warning: This project has not released its first major version.

Project for executing the Ansible playbooks for system automation.

## Quick start for local development
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/enasisnetwork/ansible-provision.git
```
Set up the Python virtual environments expected by the Makefile.
```
make -s venv-create
```

### Execute the linters and tests
The comprehensive approach is to use the `check` recipe. This will stop on
any failure that is encountered.
```
make -s check
```
However you can run the linters in a non-blocking mode.
```
make -s linters-pass
```
